<h6><em>Butterflied chicken breast stuffed with goat cheese and glazed with balsamic reduction </em></h6>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 shallot, finely diced</li>
    <li>1 cup balsamic vinegar</li>
    <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast</li>
    <li>2 oz goat cheese</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir shallot until translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour balsamic vinegar into skillet and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until balsamic vinegar mixture is reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Stir often.</li>
    <li>Cut chicken breasts from one side through the middle horizontally to within one-half inch of the other side. Open the two sides and spread them out like an open book</li>
    <li>Spread half the goat cheese onto one half of each chicken breast and drizzle 1/3 of the reduced balsamic vinegar mixture over the goat cheese. Close the chicken breasts over the goat cheese and secure with toothpicks. Arrange chicken into a baking dish. Drizzle with remaining 1/3 of the balsamic reduction.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is no longer pink inside, the filling is hot, and the juices run clear, 30 to 35 minutes. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of a filled breast should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
</ol>
